# TODO:
# 1.) Installation on Fedora 31 succeeded when installing "by hand", however
#     got error when starting up LyX "No textclass found".  This needs to
#     be investigated.
# 2.) This function was originally included in the InstallDevTools.sh script,
#     but because of the time required for this installation has been moved
#     into a dedicated script.  Installation on F31 is still experimental,
#     and optimizations remain (for example removing previous version).
